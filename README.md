# SQL
## This repository explains basic concepts of playing around with MySQL and performing C.R.U.D (Create, Read/Retrieve, Update and Delete) operations on a data in a Database.
### I personally use PopSQL and DBeaver SQL editors for running SQL queries.<br>
<b>Script-1.sql</b> - <em>company-database.png</em> is used as an reference to create tables from scratch as present in the image. All basic fucntions applied thereafter on the database that is created<br>
<b>Script-2.sql</b> - uses <em>SQLite Test.db</em> as a databases. It explains on how to use an existing database and perform certain operations on it.<br>
<b>Documentation update</b> - I have uploaded a step-by-step detailed .pdf file on how to use SQL Database editor on Microsoft Azure. It is quiet convineant to use the Azure platform to play around with SQL and use it for your cloud based activities.
